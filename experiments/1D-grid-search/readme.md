This experiment is a simple 1D grid search over wind values from 0.5m/s to 5 m/s.
Fuel loads are assumed constant for each simulation. The treatment has 1/2 the fuel load 
of the control in this case.
The purpose of this experiment is to test the slurm array workflow, FDS simulation setup, and to get test data for the postprocessing scripts.
